  ATHATH:
  - rscdel: Some redundant code from Oztek boomerangs has been removed. This should
      have pretty much no gameplay effect.
  NotRanged:
  - rscadd: Added positronic alert consoles to robotics. Ghosts can click on them
      to ping roboticists.
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Removed some bits of initial gas mixes that are explicitly the one thing
      you are not allowed to put into initial gas mixes.
  - bugfix: Added temperatures to some initial gas mixes that were missing them. This
      also breaks stuff, but at least it doesn't explicitly say that.
  - refactor: Nanotrasen overhauled much of the holodecks programming so that it didnt
      have to keep physical copies of the simulations anymore.
  - code_imp: holodeck uses map templates instead of area_copy
  pinkblossom6:
  - rscadd: Adds the Trauma Team ERT
  tf-4:
  - bugfix: Replaced the rear window of the firing range with a wall
  unit0016:
  - rscadd: Aesthetics Module Additions - More stuff for your eyes to look at!
