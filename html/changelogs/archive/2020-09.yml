      option in the IC tab. If you're an AI and you can't see anything, your camera
      may be on the wrong Z-level. Try moving it up or returning hitting the button
      to return to your core.
  - bugfix: Assuming direct control of mobs now appropriately updates the verb tabs.

      off the map in the hypothetical nullspace. Find new and creative ways to murder
      your friends!
