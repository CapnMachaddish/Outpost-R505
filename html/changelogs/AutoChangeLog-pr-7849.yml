  - bugfix: "Smart pipes now calculate their direction properly, and construction code checks direction logic properly. This fixes many problems with atmospherics construction."
  - bugfix: "Smart pipe construction now no longer tries to work around irrelevant pipes which are on completely different layers and do not interact with the new pipe in any way."
  - bugfix: "Smart pipes with less than two allowed directions can no longer be built. The pipe would be invisible, but still interact in weird ways."
  - bugfix: "One tile can no longer have more than one atmospheric component ready to connect in the same direction and layer. This prevents the scenario where a temperature pump is placed in a manner which looks like it's going to connect to a horizontal bridge pipe, but actually turns the vertical plasma input pipe behind it into a manifold, ruptures the connected plasma canister, and sets Toxins on fire.
qol: Smart pipes are now much, much smarter. During construction, if a smart pipe would block placement of a component, it will see if permitted connectivity can be reconfigured to make room for other components. This includes negotiation with other smart pipes, preferring to create pipe crossings where available, or create an opposing corner pipe if not. The RPD can now also reconfigure allowed connectivity for existing smart pipes manually. Smart pipes can never be reconfigured to have less than two allowed directions, and active connections cannot be reconfigured. Automatic reconfiguration will never cause a smart pipe to permit connectivity that was not previously permitted."
  - bugfix: "Multi-layer pipe components can trigger smart pipe negotiation where relevant."
  - refactor: "Rearranged some atmospherics pipe code. Fewer redundant loops, add and use documented and centralized helpers for bit manipulation where sensible. Make bitfield assumptions explicit."
  - code_imp: "made a small part of the documentation in the area less wrong dear god my eyes the goggles do nothing"
