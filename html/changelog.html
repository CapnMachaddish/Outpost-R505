			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="balance">ID cards have now completely changed. ID cards have limited available access slots increased by card rarity and the specific job trim. Jobs with more innate access now have more valuable ID cards. Better watch your backs!</li>
				<li class="balance">Yes, this means that you can no longer mass-distribute unrestricted All Access. During War Ops, you're expected to protect the diskie and disk holder. Sec can distribute guns. Cargo can order guns. You can still get key accesses like Maint on any ID card. HoP can still create and trim special silver ID cards for high value staff members to get more access. Adapt. Overcome. Suffer.</li>
				<li class="balance">Chameleon ID cards are completely reworked. Instead of copying all accesses from a card, they now open up an interface where you can select up to 5 accesses to copy over depending on the target card's access.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The ID Console has been updated to reflect these new changes including a somewhat improved layout. You can apply job templates direct to cards via a drop-down interface and these templates will attempt to fill out as many accesses on the card as it can based on the card's trim and the template's wildcard setup.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The PDA Painter has now been upgraded with a tgui interface. It can be used to paint PDAs the same as before, but can now also change the trim on ID cards. This procedure will remove all access levels from the ID card in the process, leaving you with a freshly trimmed blank ID card.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Captain job trims now have a white star instead of a dull grey star. removed: Mining Conscript Card has been removed and replaced with a spare mining ID that holds and has the access the Conscript card gave.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Captain's Spare ID has been moved from the Captain's locker to a secure safe on the bridge. The highest ranking Command member on shift start is given the codes to this safe, generally following the chain of command. The QM is part of this and can, in exceptional circumstances where no other heads join the shift, become Acting Captain. Their ID card would be given Bridge access if they were picked as Acting Captain to allow them to access the captain's spare. If nobody in the chain of command joins the shift, the next latejoined player from the chain of command will be given the codes for the spare and promoted to Acting Captain automatically.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The secure safe on the bridge is a special variant that is immune to conventional weaponry and lacks the hacking mechanic of ordinary wall safes. Maybe if you could examine it close enough, you'd find hints to its weaknesses...</li>
				<li class="tweak">Examining players now shows a more detailed representation of any ID card in their ID slot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the world's worst coder sprites for ID card overlays including PDA, Laptop and Wallet icons for when they're in the ID Card slot too. May God have mercy on your souls, for my spriting skills have none.</li>

				<li class="spellcheck">fixed typo on the engineering voidsuit</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Plexagon Access Management app has been upgraded and allows Heads of Staff to demote any ID card that has a trim they'd ordinarily be able to apply as a template. This means the HoS can now demote departmental sec officers like Security Officer (Science).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">A recent firmware update reenabled the screens on Nanotransen brand computers.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bloodsplatter no longer experiences phantom limb syndrome on people missing both of their arms.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Recent budget cuts have resulted in accessories no longer having magnets strong enough to pull bloodstains directly out of clothing. Washing machine usage has jumped 50% over the last week.</li>
