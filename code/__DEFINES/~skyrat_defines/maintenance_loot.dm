//boxstation: ~153 loot items spawned
//metastation: ~183 loot items spawned
//deltastation: ~165 loot items spawned

//how to balance maint loot spawns:
// 1) Ensure each category has items of approximately the same power level
// 2) Tune weight of each category until average power of a maint loot spawn is acceptable
// 3) Mapping considerations - Loot value should scale with difficulty of acquisition, or an assistaint will run through collecting free gear with no risk

//goal of maint loot:
// 1) Provide random equipment to people who take effort to crawl maint
// 2) Create memorable moments with very rare, crazy items
