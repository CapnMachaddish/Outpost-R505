## Title: Ashwalker Change

MODULE ID: ASH_CHANGE

### Description:

When ashwalkers use regenerating cores on the tendril, it'll stablize the core.

When ashwalkers use laterns on the tendril, it'll corrupt them, making them not require a battery.

When a non-ashwalker touches the tendril with their bare hands when two ashwalkers are nearby, they will be prompted if they want to turn into an ashwalker.
