This is ERP update made by Lamella Kubic-70 and Geminee.

Lamella-0587 - Created most of sprites, shitcoded.
Kubic-70 - Coded many cool items, fixed a ton of my mistakes.
Geminee - Author of many complex and hard features like "milking machine" and new slots.
The_CatFish - Helped with many sprites, author of slots icons.
CoffeeKat - The wizard of gitfuckery and just a good person.
Useroth - Helped me to learn BYOND coding and made this update possible.

Maybe I forgot someone. If i did i'm really sorry, 7 months is a long time but i appreciate help of every coder and spriter that spent their time on my idea to rework ERP system.
And i guess that's it. I never was good at epic speeches, just want to say i love you guys.
