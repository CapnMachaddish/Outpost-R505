	You're one of them, a bastardization of a human and Xenomorph. You lot tend to be outcasts, Domeheads, Jerries, those sort of insults are common.  \
	An outsider once described Xenohybrids as 'ancestor worshippers', though a more accurate phrase would be 'fetishization'. \
	Despite how loathed you are, there's one truth among your kind, you stick together."
