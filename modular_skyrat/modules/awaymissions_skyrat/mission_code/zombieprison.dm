	First off: listen to superiors. As I said, this is a spot for one of two types of people: newbies and fuck-ups. If you're here, you're being judged hard. If you get told to jump, you do it. Don't ask how high, just DO IT.
	Second, suck a lot of dick. Don't fuck around, don't be an ass, suck up as much as you can because that's the only way you're getting out. If you're lucky, you'll make it into the good ol' boys club."}

	Still, it doesn't help we've been having to deal with the fact we got some guys trapped in the damn armory. Not to mention our food stores ain't gonna last much longer without help. How long until we start to turn on each other?
	Are we just gonna be at each other's throats soon over food scraps? James said he's thinking we should make a break for the gateway, but where would we fucking go? Thing probably ain't calibrated. And that's if we made it
