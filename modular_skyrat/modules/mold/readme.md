## Title: Mold - Advanced PvE Blob-Vine Encounter

MODULE ID: `MOLD`

### Description:

100% PVE
Spreads much like glowshrooms and space vines, has a main core like a blob. During the spreading it builds structures, currently there's 2. One of them will release something harmful on proximity, another will spawn enemies. The blob also releases harmful stuff depending on the type, on cooldown.

The resin grows and bashes through doors and firelocks, when it meets a space tile it walls it off. It isn't too hard of an encounter and it doesn't spread too fast.

There's 4 types right now, for each type people should take be taking different tactics and pre-cautions.

Currently not tied to any event, just admin spawn for the purposes of tests and stuff.

When the core dies, everything slowly decays away.
